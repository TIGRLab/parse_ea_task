# parse_ea_task


TODO: 
- Fix file I/O & naming
- Add a column (or rather leave the column in) that contains the video names (vid1,vid2,cvid1,cvid2...) 
- the spasd branch should be deleted and the code should just be study agnostic and use config (ideally), if it cant thats also fine but some hardcodey nonsense will need to happen :)
